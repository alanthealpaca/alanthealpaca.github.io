<h1> Hello, World</h1>
<h5 style="color:grey">13 December 2020</h5>

I started this blog a couple of months ago, but I didn't actively start writing. I hope to change that from here onwards. 

Let's start with my motivation to do this. Before that, what's up with the (weird ?) name?


<br>
<h3 style="color:#fada5f">Why alanthealpaca ?</h3>

I started to grow fond of alpacas at the time when I finally fought against my laziness to start this blog and I also wanted it to have a unique name. So, naturally, i went with ***alfredthealpaca***, which was the first thing that sprung to mind.

As I found out a few days later, the name was not very original. In fact, there’s a character(?) of the same name in Age of Empires. I should’ve thought harder when deciding on a name. Laziness got the best of me. Once again.

So, a few days ago, I changed the name to ***alanthealpaca*** and then found out later that a character from a children’s story book was also called ***alanthealpaca***?

Man, I really should decide once and for all what the name is going to be.
<br>

No, this time for real. I’ll think hard. I promise.

<br>
<h3 style="color:#fada5f">Why did you start this blog?</h3>

Truth be told, I don't remember exactly why.

I don’t even write regularly. Scratch that. I don’t do anything regularly.

I just do something whenever I feel like doing it.

But, I have a rough idea.

After giving it some thought, I realized I want to achieve two things through this blog :
<br>
<ul>
<li>Write to an audience, receive feedback. Become a better writer. Unless they kill me for hurting their sentiments. </li>
<li>Document my journey. So that maybe I can have a laugh or be embarrassed in the future reading these again. </li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3 style="color:#fada5f">What kind of stuff can the audience expect from you?</h3>

<ul>
<li>In short, you can mostly expect stuff that my life revolves around</li>
<li>Random thoughts, ideas, opinions or maybe even tutorials on some CS related stuff (hopefully).</li>
</ul>


Hope you’ll stick around. See you in the future. That is, if I ever get the energy to write again....
